Guievict:  GUI eviction

Copyright (c) 2003 Victor C. Zandy  

Guievict is a system for checkpointing and migrating the GUI of an
X window application.  It is based on a window server extension and
runtime process re-writing; application binaries do not need to be
modified or started in a special way to be used with guievict.

We support guievict for XFree86 4.2.x running on x86 Linux.

A paper describing guievict, entitled "Checkpoints of GUI-based
Applications" (2003 Usenix Annual Technical Conference), is
available at http://ftp.cs.wisc.edu/paradyn/papers/Zandy03Checkpoints.pdf.
